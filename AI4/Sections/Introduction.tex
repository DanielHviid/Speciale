\chapter{Introduction}

In this paper we go through the motivation behind the project, as well as the theory of the Spiking Neural Network and Reservoir computing, followed by the implementation of a Liquid State Machine in a c++ environment and the tests used to ensure that the implementation works as intended including the prediction of the next item in a repeating sequence.

A Liquid State Machine is a Neural Network model that attempts to more closely resemble a biological brain than other models. It retains temporal information, and is non-differentiable. This makes the model hard to train, which is why this project only looks at training the output layer.
