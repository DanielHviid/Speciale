\section{Conclusion}

Making an artificial neural network that more closely resemble the human brain than perceptrons and similar models require spiking models as well as more reservoir-like layers. The Liquid State Machine fullfills this, as it is reservoir computing that uses spiking neuron models. This project implemented this model in a c++ environment, keeping the implementation modular to allow for easy testing. The implementation was then tested on a relatively easy case, where the Liquid State Machine was used to predict the next letter in a repeating sequence, with an accuracy of 100\%. As such, the goal of implementing and testing the Liquid State Machine was achieved.
